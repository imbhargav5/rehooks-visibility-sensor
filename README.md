# `@rehooks/visibility-sensor` *DEPRECATED. Moved to [@rooks/use-visibility-sensor](https://github.com/imbhargav5/rooks/tree/master/packages/visibility-sensor)*

> React hook for visibility sensing a ref

It checks whether an element has scrolled into view or not. A lot of the logic is taken from [react-visibility-sensor](https://github.com/joshwnj/react-visibility-sensor) and is rewritten for the hooks proposal.

> **Note:** This is using the new [React Hooks API Proposal](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
> which is subject to change until React 16.7 final.
>
> You'll need to install `react`, `react-dom`, etc at `^16.7.0-alpha.0`

## Demo

## Install

```sh
yarn add @rehooks/visibility-sensor
```

## Usage

```js
import useVisibilitySensor from "@rehooks/visibility-sensor";

function MyComponent() {
  const rootNode = useRef(null);
  const { isVisible, visibilityRect } = useVisibilitySensor(rootNode, {
    intervalCheck: false,
    scrollCheck: true,
    resizeCheck: true
  });
  return (
    <div ref={rootNode}>
      <p>
        {isVisible ? "Visible" : isVisible === null ? "Null" : "Not Visible"}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Options

The first argument of the `useVisibilitySensor` hook is a ref, the second argument is an options object. The available options are as follow:

`intervalCheck: false` - Accepts `int | bool`, if an `int` is supplied, that will be the interval in `ms` and it keeps checking for visibility

`partialVisibility: false` - Accepts `bool | string` : Tells the hook if partial visibility should be considered as visibility or not. Accepts `false` and directions `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right`
`containment: null` - A `DOMNode` element which defaults to `window`. The element relative to which visibility is checked against

`scrollCheck: true` - A `bool` to determine whether to check for scroll behavior or not

`scrollDebounce: 250` - The debounce ms for scroll

`scrollThrottle: -1` - The throttle ms for scroll. If throttle > -1, debounce is ignored.

`resizeCheck: false` - A `bool` to determine whether to check for resize behavior or not

`resizeDebounce: 250` - The debounce ms for resize

`resizeThrottle: -1` - The throttle ms for resize. If throttle > -1, debounce is ignored.

`shouldCheckOnMount: true` - A `bool` which determines whether an initial check on first render should happen or not.

`minTopValue: 0` - An `int` top value to determine what amount of top visibility should be considered for `visibility`

## Status: Yet to be published to npm

## Todo

- [x] Init
- [x] Scroll and Resize support
- [x] Debounce and throttling
- [x] Option to opt-out of initial check on mount
- [x] Documentation of all options
- [x] Tests _ WIP _
